- [x] offset the map to middle of screen
- [x] Make bullets and players as data structures

When to use smart pointers:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7657718/when-to-use-shared-ptr-and-when-to-use-raw-pointers

Herb Sutter: https://herbsutter.com/2013/06/05/gotw-91-solution-smart-pointer-parameters/
Guideline: Donâ€™t pass a smart pointer as a function parameter unless you want to use or manipulate the smart pointer itself, such as to share or transfer ownership.
Guideline: Prefer passing objects by value, *, or &, not by smart pointer.
